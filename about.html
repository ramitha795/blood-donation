  <p>We are a non-profit organization aiming to make blood easily accessible for everyone in need.<br><br>Blood donation is the process of giving blood voluntarily to help others who need it, such as accident victims, patients during operations, or people with low blood levels. Blood banks then store and distribute this blood. Donating blood is considered a generous and life-saving action that improves community health.<br><br>Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to their health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place.<br><br>The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This has led to some increased interest in autotransfusion, whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during surgery for continuous reinfusion‚Äîor alternatively, is self-donated prior to when it will be needed. Generally, the notion of donation does not refer to giving to one's self, though in this context it has become somewhat acceptably idiomatic.<br><br>Blood donations are divided into groups based on who will receive the collected blood.[3] An allogeneic (also called homologous) donation is when a donor gives blood for storage at a blood bank for transfusion to an unknown recipient. A directed donation is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for transfusion to a specific individual.[4] Directed donations are relatively rare when an established supply exists.[5] A replacement donor donation is a hybrid of the two and is common in developing countries.[6] In this case, a friend or family member of the recipient donates blood to replace the stored blood used in a transfusion, ensuring a consistent supply. When a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery, that is called an autologous donation.[7] Blood that is used to make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively used for manufacturing<br><br>The actual process varies according to the laws of the country, and recommendations to donors vary according to the collecting organization.[11][12][13] The World Health Organization gives recommendations for blood donation policies,[14] but in developing countries many of these are not followed. For example, the recommended testing requires laboratory facilities, trained staff, and specialized reagents, all of which may not be available or too expensive in developing countries.<br><br>A blood drive or a blood donor session is an event in which donors come to donate allogeneic blood. These can occur at a blood bank, but they are often set up at a location in the community, such as a shopping center, workplace, school, or house of worship.<br><br>There are two main methods of obtaining blood from a donor. The most frequent is to simply take the blood from a vein as whole blood. This blood is typically separated into parts, usually red blood cells and plasma, since most recipients (other than trauma patients) need only a specific component for transfusions.<br><br>The other method is to draw blood from the donor, separate it using a centrifuge or a filter, store the desired part, and return the rest to the donor. This process is called apheresis, and it is often done with a machine specifically designed for this purpose. This process is especially common for plasma, platelets, and red blood cells<br></p>
